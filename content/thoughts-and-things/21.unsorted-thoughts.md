Some things that cross my mind while I try to keep focussed on work...

<!--more-->

Laravel provides a number of ways to [interface with storage](https://laravel.com/docs/master/filesystem) - generally via the [phpleague's flysystem](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/docs/) package.

However, interestingly I spotted that flysystem has a [ZipArchive adapter](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/docs/adapter/zip-archive/). I was surprised to find that while laravel supports many other adapters from flysystem, this one isn't covered. It seems to me like it would be a really useful one to have, since we do occasionally need to programmatically work with zip files. It also had me wondering if it would be a viable way to store large text data in the filesystem with the benefits of compression, and maybe only some of the downsides of the additional processing required for a zipped file to be accessed again later. Heck, you could even add some kind of caching layer that would keep "hot" files in a local uncompressed location and clean them up if they're left unused for some time.

Anyway... Just a thought. Maybe I'll investigate - maybe I won't. I need to get back to work.
