My intention here is mostly to try and document / link out to other useful articles that I come across in my day-to-day.
<!--more-->

So, to get started I dropped this into my terminal:

```bash [boop.sh]{1} meta-info=peep
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

I tend to read a handful of articles each day. Most of them lead to more questions. Sometimes they give me answers to questions I have down the line... And sometimes when I want those answers they only exist in my mind as the frustrating knowledge that I've forgotten all relevant specific information I'll need.
